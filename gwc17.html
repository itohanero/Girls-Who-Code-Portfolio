	<h2 class= "reftitle"><ins>Reflection 6/27/2017</ins></h2>
  <p class= "ref1"> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that they both use the similar operators, and require the same pseudocode. 
    The differences are that the blocks of code aren't given to you and you have to have specific code syntax. Debugging my program
    was actually really fun! I don't know why, it kind of reminded me of a puzzle so I really enjoyed it and it wasn't that hard. </p>
<h2 class="reftitle"><ins>FullScreen Media Field Trip 6/28/2017</ins></h2>
  <p class= "ref1"> At Girls Who Code, I had the opportunity to take a field trip to Full Screen Media and view their building
        and meet their incredible staff.We were lucky enough to meet George Strompolos, the founder of FullScreen, and help improve their new FullScreen App. We were split into
        six groups of three and each group was paired with a mentor. My mentor was Vincent Seah who is a Principal Data Scientist at FullScreen.
        My group learned about the implicit and explicit data analyzed to provide crtical feedback for the FullScreen team. My group also 
        came up with new ideas such as live options, notifications, and an improved social part for their app. We met some of their engineers
        and software developers for their app which was so exciting. I can't wait to see Full Screen become something amazing!</p>
<h2 class= "reftitle"><ins>Adventure Game 6/29/2017</ins></h2>
    <p class= "ref1"> Today we used Python to create a text adventure game. My partner and I created a realistic trip to the pier and mall
             experience. We were able to change the outcome of the game by the user's input. We used conditionals and nested conditionals. Once again
             we tested our code through the command prompt on our computers. Insert code photo, terminal photo, and brainstorm photo.
<h2 class= "reftitle"><ins>Obamicon 6/30/2017</ins></h2>
    <p class= "ref1"> Today we learned about data structures and how to create filters on pictures using Python. We learned about creating lists  and I created a 
	    random Haiku Generator using for loops and lists. We were also split into groups to discuss different types of tools in python. 
	    My group got slicing lists. To slice a list you need to inclue [start: stop: increment] in your brackets. From the other groups,
	    I learned about the difference between list.append and list.extend. I also learned about tuples and how to search a list. Tuples 
	    are used to store an infinite amount of data that can't be changed.We were paired with a partner and 
	    worked on a program that found the sum of all the prime numbers on the list. Our final project was to create a filter that 
	    could be placed on a picture. We did this by acessing specific items on a list and using multi-dimensional lists to store d
	    different types of data. Add picture of haiku, random number, obamicon.

<h2 class = "reftitle">Intro to Robotics 7/5/2017</h2>
	<p class = "ref1"> I really enjoyed today's lesson! Today we got a taste of digital electronics. We started off lookng at different types of robots
		and defining what makes a robot one. Our class came up with the definition that robots haves to respond to iput(senses), have control schemes, and
		it should have a specific purpose. We researched different robots created such as Toymail, driverless cars, disability robots by Kavita Krishnaswamy, and 
		drones. The second portion of our class was about circuits. We researched some of the main components which are Arduino board, Board of eEducation 
		shield, breadboards, jumpwires, resistors, LEDs, servos, and piezos. We then broke off into groups to build our own circuit board.
		We created a series circuit with two LED lights. One of my favorite circuits we created was the series circuit with 2 LEDs and a button. I learned
		a lot about circuit today. We made so may mistakes such as putting a positive and negitive wire of a light in the same row. We also made the
		same mistake with resistors. I learned that the current can't pass through these wires when they are placed there.  It was fun to work in 
		a group and fail and grow together. My idea of robots changed today because many things can be considered robots depending on who you ask. 
		I also learned that as great as robots are it can cause a lot of social and economic problems. Such as robots can take away jobs an worry about privacy.
		However, with any change comes a lot of pros and cons. I am excited for the future of robotics and that's part of the reason that I joined
		my VEX Robotics team. The chance to create new tech excites me! In addition to the great tech, we were able to hear a speaker named Lauren Wong.
		She actually did the Girls Who COde Internship one summer and is now going into college. It was great hearing from someone who has
		been in our shoes. She works with Social Media and Computer Science. She gave us great resources and tips for highschool and college which was 
		really intrsting. Now she is going to be studying Communications and Computer Science. It was great to see how Girls Who Code offered so many
		opportunities for her.

	  <h2 class ="reftitle">Blinking LEDs 7/6/2017</h2>
	  	<p class = "ref1"> Today we were able to build circuits and program on Arduino boards to create a  mini light show with the LEDs. 
			My team programed an LED to turn on an off using Arduino C and control multiple LEDs using an array. We learned about the different 
			variables in Arduino C such as pinMode, voidSetup, digitalWrite, delay, and more. First we programmed code to make out LEDs blink. Then, we
			researched a couple of AMAZING women in tech. Some of them include Ayanna Howard and Manuelo Veloso. The creative work that they have
			done in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science is inspiring. Some of the robots that they have built sucha NASA robots,
			robo cup, and even a walking helping robot. Our teamwork could have improved because not everyone ws given the chance to have hands-on experience
			with the ciruits, but we will definitely improve next time. I learned from this group that you have to speak up when you have an idea nd be
			mindful that everyone in the group gets a good learning experience. From building circuits, I learned the difference between analog vs digital.
			We also was able to hear from an gret speaker named Sarah. She currently is VP of Mobile Experience at AT&T. She also worked as a presss relations
			manager, anaylist, and more. It was exciting to see how she applies tech to her field of expertise.

       <h4>Functions</h4>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
         <li>Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually 
           "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. </li>
         <li>Functions basically are processors. I think of it like a printer. Your computer sends it the data and the printer takes 
         that data and prints out a document.</li>
         <li></li>
         <li></li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Loops</h4>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
         <li>A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</li>
         <li>Loops are continously conducted like a machine continously completes a process</li>
        </ul>
