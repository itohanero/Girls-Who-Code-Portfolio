  Step out of your comfort zones and soar, all right?</blockquote></P>
<h2 class= "reftitle"><ins>Reflection 6/27/2017</ins></h2>
  <p class= "ref1"> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that they both use the similar operators, and require the same pseudocode. 
    The differences are that the blocks of code aren't given to you and you have to have specific code syntax. Debugging my program
    was actually really fun! I don't know why, it kind of reminded me of a puzzle so I really enjoyed it and it wasn't that hard. </p>
<h2 class="reftitle"><ins>FullScreen Media Field Trip 6/28/2017</ins></h2>
  <p class= "ref1"> At Girls Who Code, I had the opportunity to take a field trip to Full Screen Media and view their building
        and meet their incredible staff.
        We were lucky enough to meet George Strompolos, the founder of FullScreen, and help improve their new FullScreen App. We were split into
        six groups of three and each group was paired with a mentor. My mentor was Vincent Seah who is a Principal Data Scientist at FullScreen.
        My group learned about the implicit and explicit data analyzed to provide crtical feedback for the FullScreen team. My group also 
        came up with new ideas such as live options, notifications, and an improved social part for their app. We met some of their engineers
        and software developers for their app which was so exciting. I can't wait to see Full Screen become something amazing!</p>
<h2 class= "reftitle"><ins>Adventure Game 6/29/2017</ins></h2>
    <p class= "ref1"> Today we used Python to create a text adventure game. My partner and I created a realistic trip to the pier and mall
             experience. We were able to change the outcome of the game by the user's input. We used conditionals and nested conditionals. Once again
             we tested our code through the command prompt on our computers. Insert code photo, terminal photo, and brainstorm photo.
<h2 class= "reftitle"><ins>Obamicon 6/30/2017</ins></h2>
    <p class= "ref1"> Today we learned about dta structures and how to create filters on pictures using Python. We learned about creating lists  and I created a 
	    random Haiku Generator using for loops and lists. We were also split into groups to discuss different types of tools in python. 
	    My group got slicing lists. To slice a list you need to inclue [start: stop: increment] in your brackets. From the other groups,
	    I learned about the difference between list.append and list.extend. I also learned about tuples and how to search a list. Tuples 
	    are used to store an infinite amount of data that can't be changed.We were paired with a partner and 
	    worked on a program that found the sum of all the prime numbers on the list. Our final project was to create a filter that 
	    could be placed on a picture. We did this by acessing specific items on a list and using multi-dimensional lists to store d
	    different types of data. Add picture of haiku, random number, obamicon.

       <h4>Functions</h4>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
         <li>Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually 
           "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. </li>
         <li>Functions basically are processors. I think of it like a printer. Your computer sends it the data and the printer takes 
         that data and prints out a document.</li>
         <li></li>
         <li></li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Loops</h4>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
         <li>A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</li>
         <li>Loops are continously conducted like a machine continously completes a process</li>
        </ul>
