  Step out of your comfort zones and soar, all right?</blockquote></P>
<h2 class= "reftitle"><ins>Reflection 6/27/2017</ins></h2>
  <p class= "ref1"> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that they both use the similar operators, and require the same pseudocode. 
    The differences are that the blocks of code aren't given to you and you have to have specific code syntax. Debugging my program
    was actually really fun! I don't know why, it kind of reminded me of a puzzle so I really enjoyed it and it wasn't that hard. </p>
    <h2 class="reftitle"><ins>FullScreen Media Field Trip 6/28/2017</ins><h2>
      <p class = "ref1">At Girls Who Code, I had the opportunity to take a field trip to Full Screen Media and view their building
        and meet their incredible staff.
        We were lucky enough to meet George Strompolos, the founder of FullScreen, and help improve their new FullScreen App. We were split into
        six groups of three and each group was paired with a mentor. My mentor was Vincent Seah who is a Principal Data Scientist at FullScreen.
        My group learned about the implicit and explicit data analyzed to provide crtical feedback for the FullScreen team. My group also 
        came up with new ideas such as live options, notifications, and an improved social part for their app. We met some of their engineers
        and software developers for their app which was so exciting. I can't wait to see Full Screen become something amazing!
