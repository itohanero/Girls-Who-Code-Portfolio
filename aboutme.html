    <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I currently attend CAMS which is located on the college campus of Cal Sate Dominguez Hills</p>
<h2>Reflection 6/27/2017</h2>
  <p>Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that they both use the similar operators, and require the same pseudocode. 
    The differences are that the blocks of code aren't given to you and you have to have specific code syntax. Debugging my program
    was actually really fun! I don't know why, it kind of reminded me of a puzzle so I really enjoyed it and it wasn't that hard.</p>
